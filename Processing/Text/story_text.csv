0,0,None,Introduction ,None,"As the threats of climate change increase, destructive storms like Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Harvey will expose the vulnerabilities of costal communities overburdened by industrial and chemical facilities. Of interest are NYC’s Significant Maritime and Industrial Areas (SMIAs), clusters of industry and polluting infrastructure along the waterfront. SMIAs are located in classic environmental justice communities- predominantly low-income communities of color - in the south Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, which are also hurricane storm surge zones. The WJP is a research and advocacy campaign focusing on community resiliency that seeks to reduce potential toxic exposures and public health risks associated with climate change and storm surge in the City’s industrial waterfront."
0,0,Highlight,What is a SMIA?,None,"Significant Maritime and Industrial Areas (SMIAs) are zones designated under the Waterfront Revitalization Project in order to encourage the protection and siting of industrial and maritime uses alon gthe waterfront. There are only seven SMIAs in the city, all located in predominatly low-income, communities of color. NYC-EJA's research has shown that the SMIAs are all in storm surge zones, and that the City of New York had not analyzed the cumulative contamination exposure risks associated with clusters of heavy industrial use. "
0,0,Highlight,Where are SMIAs?,None,This map shows the seven SMIAs (outlined in solid black) as well as a half mile buffer to SMIAs (outlined in a dashed line) to determine communities located in close proximity. Half a mile is the distance often used to study environmental impact under NY's environmental regulatory framework. 
0,0,Percent People of Color,People of Color,None,"This map shows the percentage of population of people of color by census tract. Census tracts in dark purple denote areas where more than 66% of the community are people of color. As you can see, the majority of areas around SMIAs represent populations of color. In fact, of the total 5.5 million people of color in NYC, 2.8 million in census tracts that are vulnerable to storm surge and approximately 430,000 live in census tracts that are both vulnerable to storm surage and fall with a half-mile of SMIAs. "
0,0,Zoning,Land Use,None,"This land use map shows that industrial and manufacturing uses are concentrated in the SMIAs. The SMIAs are purple accounting for ""industrial and manufacturing"" uses, but these areas are surrounded by shares of yellow, denoting the presence of residential uses. Note that this map does not take into account non-conforming uses where former manufacturing buildings are being used for residential use, as is the case in Greenpoint or Williamsburg. "
0,0,Percent of Families Below Poverty Line,Families Below Poverty Line,None,"This map shows the percentage of families below poverty level population by census tract. Census tracts with dark red denote areas where more than 66% of the community is below poverty level. In fact of the total X million low-income population in NYC. 1.6 million live in census tracts that are vulnerable to hurricane storm surge, and 283,000 live in census tracts that are both vulnerable to storm surge and fall within a half-mile of SMIAs. "
0,0,Median Household Income,Median Household Income,None,"Similarly, this map shows the median household income of families by census tract. Census tracts which are dark green indicate lower income households. Many low income households live in or in half-mile proximity to SMIAs. "
0,0,Percent Uninsured,Percent Without Health Insurance,None,"Furthermore, using data from the NYC department of Health and Mental Hygiene we can see that SMIAs and the adjacent areas include some of the highest levels of the uninsured people by community district (dark blue), which denotes limited access to health insurance in the event of a toxic exposure. Note that that in hatched community districts, estimates of percent uninsured should be interepreted with caution. "
0,0,Hurricane Evacuation Zones,Hurricane Evacuation Zones ,None,"Hurricane evacuation zones, provided by NYC  emergency management, show that SMIAs are highly vulnerable to hurricane damage. This presents a threat to communities who live in such areas. "
0,0,Bulk Storage Sites,Sources of Toxic Waste,None,"This map shows facilies handling hazardous substances or toxic chemicals in these areas that could represent a threat in the event of hurricane storm sturge. Among these are NY State DEC regulated class 2 Superfund sites - sites determined to pose significant threat to pulic health or the environment and requiring immediate action. We also show NYS DEC regulated active bulk chemical and major oil storage facilities, which store hazardous substances or have the capacity to store 400,000 gallons of oil. Finally we show the location of facilities reporting chemicals in the Toxics Release Inventory under the US EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know act. "
0,0,Hurricane Storm Surge Zones,Hurricane Storm Surge ,"Bulk Storage Sites,MOSF,CBS,SUPERFUND2",The SMIAs and their surroundings are highly vulnerable to hurricane storm surge. This map shows that the SMIA boundaries and storm surge zones (as defined by the NYS Emergency Management Office). Facilities handling hazardous substances or toxic chemicals in these areas could represent a threat in the event of a hurricane storm storm surge. 
0,0,None,Examining individual SMIAs,None,"As we have shown, SMIAs and their surroundings have many industrial and toxic industries, as well as being vulnerable to storms and being home to more people of color, people below poverty line, and people without insurance. The combination of these factors creates a situation where the communities near SMIAs are vulnerable to possible toxic waste spillage in the event of storms. "
2,1,Percent People of Color,"SMIA #1, Brooklyn Navy Yard",None,"The Brooklyn Navy Yard is a 227-acre publicly owned industrial park characterized by a diversity of small businesses. The Navy Yard has more than 2,000 permanent jobs on site, and provides an estimated 3,000 temporary jobs to crews of film and television shoots at Steiner Studios. The robust increase in business activity between 200 and 2008 is attributed to a dramatic redevelopment effort, harnessing more than $500 million in public and private investment.

0,0,None,Conclusion,None,"As shown in these maps, the presence of vulnerable communities, manufacturing, and toxic waste in areas susceptible to storm damage could create a threat to communities in these areas. More work is needed to understand how these communities are threatened and what can be done to alleviate the threat.
