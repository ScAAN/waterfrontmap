0,Introduction,"As the threats of climate change increase, destructive storms like Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Harvey will expose the vulnerabilities of costal communities overburdened by industrial and chemical facilities. Of interest are NYC’s Significant Maritime and Industrial Areas (SMIAs), clusters of industry and polluting infrastructure along the waterfront. SMIAs are located in classic environmental justice communities- predominantly low-income communities of color - in the south Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, which are also hurricane storm surge zones. The WJP is a research and advocacy campaign focusing on community resiliency that seeks to reduce potential toxic exposures and public health risks associated with climate change and storm surge in the City’s industrial waterfront."
1,Brooklyn Navy Yard,"The Brooklyn Navy Yard is a 227-acre publicly owned industrial park characterized by a diversity of small businesses. The Navy Yard has more than 2,000 permanent jobs on site, and provides an estimated 3,000 temporary jobs to crews of film and television shoots at Steiner Studios. The robust increase in business activity between 200 and 2008 is attributed to a dramatic redevelopment effort, harnessing more than $500 million in public and private investment.

This is an area under development and as the population and maritime industry in the area increase, more will be known about how the SMIA designation of this area relates to the local industry and demographics. <a href=""https://www.nycedc.com/sites/default/files/filemanager/Resources/Studies/Working_West_Shore_2030/WestShoreThreeYearWorkPlan.pdf"">(See: NYS EDC Working Westshore 2030)</a>"
