SMIAs are located in classic environmental justice communities- predominantly low-income communities of color - in the south Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, which are also hurricane storm surge zones. The WJP is a research and advocacy campaign focusing on community resiliency that seeks to reduce potential toxic exposures and public health risks associated with climate change and storm surge in the City\u2019s industrial waterfront.",
